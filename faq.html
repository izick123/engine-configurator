            <summary>What engine sizes do you offer?</summary>
            <p>
              We currently offer three displacements: 198cc, 212cc, and 224cc.
              Each comes in multiple trims with different internals, airflow, and exhaust.

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Are the engines hand-built?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. Every SPX engine is assembled by hand with upgraded components
              and checked before it leaves our shop.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Do you dyno test the engines?</summary>
            <p>
              Our premium builds are dyno-tested during development. Some packages
              include an optional dyno sheet with estimated horsepower.
            </p>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Is horsepower guaranteed?</summary>
            <p>
              Horsepower figures are estimates based on our testing. Real-world
              numbers can vary with fuel, elevation, weather, and your setup.

          <h2>Support & Warranty</h2>
          <details class="faq-item" open>
            <summary>What kind of support do you offer?</summary>
            <p>
              We provide startup guidance and tuning advice. Once the engine is running
              and modified, maintenance and operation are the owner’s responsibility.

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Do you offer a warranty?</summary>
            <p>
              Because these are racing engines, coverage is extremely limited. Any
              disassembly, non-SPX modifications, or abuse voids coverage immediately.
            </p>

            <summary>Can you help me choose the right engine?</summary>
            <p>
              Absolutely. Tell us about your kart, intended use, driver weight and goals,
              and we’ll suggest a displacement and trim that fits your needs.
            </p>

              We currently focus on U.S. customers. If you’re outside the U.S., send us
              a message and we can discuss options.
