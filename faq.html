          <h2>Engines & Builds</h2>

          <details class="faq-item" open>
            <summary>What engine sizes do you offer?</summary>
            <p>
              We currently offer three main displacements: 198cc, 212cc, and 224cc.
              Each platform has multiple trim levels with different internal parts,
              airflow, and exhaust options.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Are the engines hand-built?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. Every SPX engine is hand-assembled with upgraded components.
              Clearances and critical fasteners are checked before it leaves our hands.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Do you dyno test the engines?</summary>
            <p>
              Our higher trim engines are dyno-tested during development. Production
              racing builds are test-run and tuned; some packages include a dyno
              sheet with estimated horsepower.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Is horsepower guaranteed?</summary>
            <p>
              Horsepower numbers are estimates based on our testing. Actual power
              can vary with fuel, elevation, weather, and the rest of your setup.
              Always treat printed numbers as estimates, not guarantees.
            </p>

          <h2>Support & Warranty</h2>

          <details class="faq-item" open>
            <summary>What kind of support do you offer?</summary>
            <p>
              We provide startup guidance, basic tuning tips, and recommendations
              for safe use. Once the engine is running and modified, responsibility
              for maintenance and operation is on the owner.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Do you offer a warranty?</summary>
            <p>
              Due to the racing use-case, coverage is very limited. Any internal
              disassembly, non-SPX modifications, or abusive use voids coverage
              immediately. Race parts are always “use at your own risk.”
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Can you help me choose the right engine?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. Tell us your kart, track type, driver weight, and goals. We’ll
              suggest a displacement and trim that fits what you’re trying to do.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Do you ship outside the U.S.?</summary>
            <p>
              We’re currently focused on U.S. customers. If you’re outside the U.S.,
              send us a message and we can discuss possible options.
