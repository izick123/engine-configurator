          <h2>Engines & Builds</h2>

          <details class="faq-item" open>
            <summary>What engine sizes do you offer?</summary>
            <p>
              We currently offer three main displacements: 198cc, 212cc, and
              224cc. Each has multiple trim levels with different internal
              components, airflow, and exhaust options.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Are these engines hand-built?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. Every SPX engine is assembled by hand, with upgraded
              components and clearances checked before it leaves our hands.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Do you dyno test the engines?</summary>
            <p>
              Our racing engines are test-run and tuned. Premium builds include
              dyno-tested power figures with a printout of the results.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Is horsepower guaranteed?</summary>
            <p>
              Horsepower numbers are estimates based on our testing. Actual
              power can vary depending on fuel, elevation, weather, and the
              rest of your setup.
            </p>

          <h2>Support & Warranty</h2>

          <details class="faq-item" open>
            <summary>What kind of support do you offer?</summary>
            <p>
              We offer startup and setup guidance, plus general tuning advice.
              Once the engine is running and modified, responsibility for
              maintenance and operation is on the owner.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Do you offer a warranty?</summary>
            <p>
              Due to the racing nature of these engines, we offer very limited
              warranty coverage. Any disassembly, internal modification, or
              abuse will void the warranty immediately.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Can you help me pick parts?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. If you’re unsure what displacement or trim is right for your
              kart, send us a message and tell us your goals. We’ll help you
              spec a setup.
            </p>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Do you ship outside the U.S.?</summary>
            <p>
              At this time we are focused on U.S. customers only. If you are
              outside the U.S., reach out and we can discuss options.
