        <h2>Engines &amp; Performance</h2>

        <h3>Do SPX engines come with a warranty?</h3>
        <p>
          SPX engines are built for competition use only and are not covered by a traditional warranty.
          Every build is inspected before it leaves, but racing parts live a hard life.
        </p>

        <h3>How much horsepower will my engine make?</h3>
        <p>
          The builder shows an estimated horsepower number based on your selected upgrades.
          Real-world power can vary with tuning, fuel, gearing, driver weight, weather, and track conditions.
        </p>

        <h3>Do you offer dyno testing?</h3>
        <p>
          Dyno testing is available as an optional add-on package on select builds.
          When included, we provide a dyno sheet showing the tested output of that configuration.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I run pump gas?</h3>
        <p>
          Most SPX combinations are designed around premium pump gas. If you plan to run race fuel or ethanol,
          mention it in your message and we’ll advise on a safe setup.
        </p>

        <h2>Ordering &amp; Support</h2>

        <h3>Can I place an order right now?</h3>
        <p>
          We’re not currently taking online orders. When you reach the checkout step in the builder,
          you’ll see a notice and a way to join our waitlist by leaving your email.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I get support?</h3>
        <p>
          Use the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a> to reach us. We can help with choosing a displacement,
          upgrade path, or general tuning questions for your setup.
        </p>

        <h3>Do you ship outside the U.S.?</h3>
        <p>
          Right now we primarily support U.S. customers. If you’re outside the U.S., send us a message
          and we’ll let you know what’s possible.
        </p>

        <h3>Is horsepower guaranteed?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Horsepower figures are estimates based on our testing and experience.
          Track conditions, maintenance, and installation all play a role in your actual results.
