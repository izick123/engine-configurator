    <!-- Who We Are -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        It all started on a warm summer afternoon deep in Northern Wisconsin.
        Two brothers — <strong>Marty</strong> and <strong>Tom</strong> — along with their close friend
        <strong>Isaac</strong>, formed their own home-grown go-kart racing league.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using local trails and improvised circuits as their Grand Prix tracks,
        the three quickly realized something — stock engines weren’t cutting it.
        They craved more speed. More torque. More power. And the only way to get it
        was to build everything themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        What started as tinkering in a garage turned into full-fledged
        high-performance engineering. Every SPX engine is still built
        by hand, in-house, and tuned for one purpose:
        <strong>extracting every last drop of power.</strong>
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Who Our Engines Are For -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Who Our Engines Are For</h2>
      <p>
        SPX engines and our F1-inspired go-karts are engineered for adults —
        these are <strong>not toys</strong>. We build for riders and racers who want
        maximum output without compromise. Whether it’s a mini bike,
        a go-kart, or even a racing lawn tractor, our engines deliver
        <strong>more than enough power</strong> to satisfy serious builders.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’ve bought a kart or mini bike and aren’t sure what to upgrade next,
        our customizable engine lineup makes it simple:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Pick your displacement</li>
        <li>Choose your performance upgrades</li>
        <li>Order it ready to run</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        No wrenching required — just mount the engine and you're ready to rip.
      </p>

      <h2>Important Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        All engines ship <strong>without fluids</strong>.
        Customers are required to add their own oil and fuel.
        Starting an engine without oil will result in catastrophic damage
        and <strong>voids any warranty</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each engine is test-started before shipping. After testing,
        all fluids are drained and the unit is packaged for transport.
        We strongly recommend performing a proper break-in procedure
        before your first full-power run.
